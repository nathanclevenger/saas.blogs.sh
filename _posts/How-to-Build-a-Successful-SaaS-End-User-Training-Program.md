# How to Build a Successful SaaS End-User Training Program

As a SaaS founder, your product is only as successful as your users' ability to utilize it. No matter how groundbreaking your software is, if your end-users don't know how to use it or find it too complicated, they won't continue using it for long. That's why it's essential to have an effective end-user training program in place that helps users get up to speed with using your SaaS product. In this post, we'll discuss the key steps to building a successful SaaS end-user training program.

## Step 1: Identify Your End-User Needs

The first step in building a successful SaaS end-user training program is to identify your end-user needs. What kind of training do your users need to be able to use your product effectively? Start by identifying your users' technical proficiency level and what they need to learn to use your software. For instance, if your product is a project management tool, users might need to know how to create a new project, assign tasks, and track progress. 

Once you have identified what users need to learn, assess the best way to deliver the training material. Consider how your users prefer to consume information. Do they prefer video tutorials, in-app guided tours, or written training material? 

By understanding your users' needs, you can develop an end-user training program that meets them where they are.

## Step 2: Create a Training Plan

Once you have identified your users' needs, the next step is to create a training plan. Your plan should cover what users need to learn and how long it will take to complete the training. Consider breaking down the training into smaller modules, each covering an essential feature or function of your SaaS product. 

It's essential to consider how the training modules build upon each other. Start with basic training, and progress to more advanced features to ensure the learning experience is logical and builds on prior knowledge. 

The plan should also consider the pace of the content delivery. Too much or too little content can lead to users feeling overwhelmed or unchallenged, leading to them abandoning the training or the product itself. 

Finally, make sure the plan is adjustable. As your product evolves, so must your training plan.

## Step 3: Choose the Right Training Medium

Once you have a training plan, the next step is to choose the right training medium. There are several ways to deliver training, including:

### In-Product Training

In-product training is a form of training delivered within the product itself. This type of training includes guided tours, tooltips, and small dialogue boxes that pop up when a user accesses a new feature for the first time. In-product training is ideal for users who prefer hands-on learning and can be a convenient way to support self-paced learning.

### Video Training

Video training is a type of training delivered via pre-recorded or live video sessions. Video training is ideal for more complex concepts or for users who learn better through visual stimuli. They can be pre-recorded and shared or broadcasted live for a more interactive experience.

### Virtual Instructor-Led Training (VILT)

VILT refers to live training sessions delivered via the internet by a live instructor. VILT can be a good option for users who need one-on-one interaction with an instructor and can be designed to cater to specific user needs.

### Written Documentation

Written documentation, such as user manuals, PDF guides, and knowledge bases, can be a good option for users who prefer self-paced learning. These materials are especially useful for users who prefer to read and learn in-depth about a specific feature or concept.

When selecting the right training medium, consider your users' learning preferences and the content you wish to deliver.

## Step 4: Establish a Training Schedule

Once you have your training plan and medium, establish a training schedule. Your schedule should be clear and well-communicated to users. Establishing a schedule ensures users are aware of when to expect training and when to return to their work. 

At the beginning of the training, inform the users of the training schedule and break down training segments into manageable chunks to reduce information overload.

## Step 5: Monitor Progress and Adjust Course

Monitoring user progress throughout the training program is essential to deliver a successful and effective training program. You can do this by requiring users to complete assessments or quizzes after each training module. Using tools like Google Forms, Typeform, or SurveyMonkey can help you create these quizzes.

Course adjustments should be based on insights from monitoring, user feedback, or changes to the SaaS product. Incorporating user feedback throughout the training program ensures users feel heard and appreciated while providing valuable feedback to refine the program's structure and content.

## Step 6: Create Training Resources

Another great way to build a successful SaaS end-user training program is by creating resources that aren't directly linked to the training but can add value to the users' overall learning journey. These resources can include:

### Knowledgebase

A knowledge base is an online library that provides users with insights and helpful resources. A knowledge base allows users to access a vast collection of resources, including tutorials, user guides, and product documentation.

By providing an extensive knowledge base, your users will be able to troubleshoot problems, find answers to their questions, and learn more about your product.

### Blog Posts

Blogs can be a great way to create user-friendly and valuable resources for your users. By providing content related to real-world scenarios and frequently asked questions, users get a sense of the product's application and how it can help them solve their problems.

### Webinars

Webinars are live online sessions focused on a specific topic or area. They're similar to virtual instructor-led training (VILT) but are usually less formal and shorter. Webinars can be an excellent way to present a new feature launch or answer frequently asked questions.

By creating these resources, you nurture your relationship with your users and empower them to learn and grow with your product.

## Step 7: Provide Ongoing Support

The final step in building a successful SaaS end-user training program is to provide ongoing support. Even with the best-designed training programs, users may still face issues or have questions. Ensure there's ongoing support in place for users, whether in the form of a dedicated support team or a designated contact person within the organization.

By providing ongoing support, users can continue to learn about your product and overcome any roadblocks that may arise.

Putting It All Together

In conclusion, building a successful SaaS end-user training program requires a solid understanding of user needs, an effective training plan, and an understanding of the right training medium. Monitor progress and adjust course as needed to provide efficient and effective training. Creating training resources and providing ongoing support also ensure users continue to learn and utilize your product long after the initial training program.

Building a successful SaaS end-user training program isn't a one-off task. It's an ongoing process that requires dedication and resources to be effective. However, a well-designed program can go a long way in ensuring your users are happy, successful, and continue to use your product.
