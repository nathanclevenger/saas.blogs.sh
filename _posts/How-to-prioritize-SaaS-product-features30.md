# How to Prioritize SaaS Product Features

For a SaaS company, it can be challenging to prioritize which product features to develop next. With a multitude of potential features and limited resources, choosing what to focus on can seem overwhelming. However, by following several key steps, you can create a structured methodology for prioritizing SaaS product features.

## Step 1: Define Your Product Vision

Before you can begin prioritizing product features, it's essential to define your product vision. Your product vision should articulate your product's purpose, your target market, and your long-term goals. 

For example, suppose you have developed a productivity software that's targeted at remote teams. In that case, your product vision statement might be: *We aim to build a productivity software solution that can help remote teams manage their workflow efficiently, resulting in increased productivity, reduced costs, and happier team members.*

Having a clear product vision statement will help you and your team focus on the features that will help you achieve your long-term goals.

## Step 2: Conduct Market Research

After you've defined your product vision, it's time to conduct market research. This involves analyzing data from your industry, researching customer needs, and assessing the competition.

Market research helps you identify customer problems and pain points, so you can address them with your product features. It also helps you understand the competitive landscape and identify opportunities for differentiation.

## Step 3: Create a Prioritization Framework

Once you have a clear understanding of your target market and competition, the next step is to create a framework for prioritizing product features. 

There are several prioritization techniques you can use, such as:

**1. Kano Model**

The Kano model is a framework for prioritizing product features based on their ability to satisfy customer needs. The model categorizes product features into three categories:

- Basic Needs: Product features that customers expect as standard.
- Performance Needs: Product features that increase customer satisfaction when done well.
- Excitement Needs: Product features that exceed customer expectations.

Using the Kano model, you can prioritize features based on their impact on customer satisfaction, with excitement needs taking priority.

**2. Cost of Delay**

The Cost of Delay (CoD) framework prioritizes features based on the cost of delaying their implementation. The CoD framework takes into account the revenue you could generate from a feature, the opportunity cost of not implementing the feature, and the risk of not implementing the feature.

By using the CoD framework, you can prioritize features that generate the most revenue or have the highest opportunity cost.

**3. Weighted Scoring**

Weighted scoring is a prioritization technique that assigns scores to features based on their importance, complexity, and impact. Using this technique, you can prioritize features based on their overall score, with higher-scoring features taking priority.

## Step 4: Categorize Features into Epics and User Stories

Once you have a prioritization framework, it's time to categorize features into epics and user stories. Epics are high-level features that describe the overall objective, while user stories are specific requirements that make up that epic.

By categorizing features into epics and user stories, you can break complex features down into manageable pieces, making it easier to prioritize and implement them.

## Step 5: Assign Priorities and Plan Sprint Backlogs

After you have categorized features into epics and user stories, it's time to assign priorities and plan sprint backlogs. A sprint backlog is a list of tasks that your team will work on during a sprint, which is typically a two-week period.

By assigning priorities, you can ensure that your team focuses on the most important features during each sprint. This helps you ensure that you're always building towards your long-term goals.

## Conclusion

Prioritizing SaaS product features is essential if you want to develop a successful product that meets customer needs and exceeds their expectations. By following these five steps, you can create a methodology for prioritizing features that aligns with your product vision, takes into account customer needs and competitive pressures, and helps you achieve your long-term goals.
