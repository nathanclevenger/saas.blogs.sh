# The Pros and Cons of Building a Hybrid SaaS Product

A hybrid SaaS product is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product that combines elements of both on-premise and cloud-based software delivery models. This means that some features of the product are delivered through the cloud, while others are installed locally on a user's computer or device. As with any business decision, building a hybrid SaaS product involves weighing the pros and cons. In this article, we will cover some of the key benefits and drawbacks of building a hybrid SaaS product, so that SaaS founders can make an informed decision.

## Pros of Building a Hybrid SaaS Product

### Greater Control Over the Product

One of the biggest advantages of building a hybrid SaaS product is that it gives you greater control over the product. With a traditional cloud-based SaaS product, you may be limited in terms of the features you can offer, as all of the product's features must be delivered through the cloud. However, with a hybrid SaaS product, you can offer some features that are delivered through the cloud, while others are installed locally on users' devices. This gives you greater flexibility and control over the product's development, and allows you to create a more robust product.

### Better Local Performance

Another advantage of building a hybrid SaaS product is that it can offer better local performance. When some of the product's features are installed locally on users' devices, those features can be faster and more responsive than if they were delivered through the cloud. This can be especially important for features that require a lot of processing power, such as video editing or other creative applications.

### Easier Integration with Legacy Systems

A hybrid SaaS product can also be easier to integrate with legacy systems than a purely cloud-based product. Because some features of the product are installed locally, they can interact more seamlessly with other software that is installed on users' computers. This can be especially important for businesses that have invested heavily in legacy systems, as it can be difficult to move everything to the cloud at once.

### More Control Over Data Security

Finally, a hybrid SaaS product can offer more control over data security. With a purely cloud-based product, all of the product's data is stored in the cloud, which can make it more vulnerable to security breaches. However, with a hybrid SaaS product, some of the product's data is stored locally on users' devices, which can make it more difficult for hackers to gain access.

## Cons of Building a Hybrid SaaS Product

While there are certainly benefits to building a hybrid SaaS product, there are also some drawbacks that SaaS founders should keep in mind.

### More Complex Development

Building a hybrid SaaS product is often more complex than building a purely cloud-based product. This is because you must develop both cloud-based and locally-installed features, which can require different technologies and programming languages. Additionally, you may need to create different versions of your product for different operating systems, which can add complexity to the development process.

### Harder to Update and Maintain

Another potential drawback of a hybrid SaaS product is that it can be harder to update and maintain. Because some features of the product are installed locally on users' devices, you may need to release updates to those features separately from updates to the cloud-based features. This can be difficult to manage, especially if you have a large user base with many different configurations.

### More Costly Infrastructure

Building a hybrid SaaS product can also be more expensive than building a purely cloud-based product. This is because you will need to maintain both cloud-based infrastructure and the infrastructure needed to support the locally-installed features of the product. Additionally, you may need to invest in additional infrastructure to support the synchronization of data between the cloud and local installations of the product.

### More Complex Licensing

Finally, licensing a hybrid SaaS product can be more complex than licensing a purely cloud-based product. This is because you will need to create different licensing models for the cloud-based and locally-installed features of the product. Additionally, you may need to consider different pricing models for different configurations of the product.

## Conclusion

Building a hybrid SaaS product can be a good choice for some SaaS founders, but it is important to weigh the pros and cons carefully. Depending on the nature of your product and your target market, a hybrid SaaS product could offer benefits such as greater control over the product, better local performance, easier integration with legacy systems, and more control over data security. However, it could also have drawbacks such as more complex development, harder updating and maintaining, more costly infrastructure, and more complex licensing. Ultimately, the decision to build a hybrid SaaS product should be based on a comprehensive analysis of your product and your market, as well as an understanding of the benefits and drawbacks discussed in this article.
