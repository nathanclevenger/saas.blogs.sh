# How to Measure Your SaaS Growth Hacking Success

Growth hacking has become a buzzword in the world of startups, and for good reason. It’s a process that combines marketing, product development, and analytics to drive exponential growth for your business. But how do you measure the success of your growth hacking efforts? In this post, we’ll cover some of the key metrics you should be tracking.

##1. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

MRR is the amount of revenue your SaaS business generates each month. This is one of the most important metrics to track because it represents the financial health of your business. If your MRR is consistently increasing, it’s a sign that your growth hacking efforts are working.

To calculate your MRR, simply multiply your total number of customers by your average monthly revenue per customer. For example, if you have 100 customers and each pays $50 per month, your MRR would be $5,000.

##2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

CAC is the amount you spend on marketing and sales efforts to acquire one new customer. This metric is important to track because it helps you understand the cost of acquiring new customers and how it affects your bottom line.

To calculate your CAC, divide your total marketing and sales expenses by the number of new customers acquired in a given time period. For example, if you spent $10,000 on marketing and sales and acquired 100 customers, your CAC would be $100.

##3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

CLV is the amount of revenue your business can expect to generate from a single customer over their lifetime. This metric is important because it helps you understand the long-term value of your customers and how much you can invest in acquiring new ones.

To calculate your CLV, multiply your average monthly revenue per customer by the average length of time a customer stays with your business. For example, if your average monthly revenue per customer is $50 and the average length of time a customer stays with your business is two years, your CLV would be $1,200.

##4. Conversion Rate

Conversion rate measures the percentage of website visitors who take a desired action. This could be signing up for a free trial, downloading an e-book, or making a purchase. Conversion rate is an important metric to track because it helps you understand how effective your website and marketing efforts are at driving action.

To calculate your conversion rate, divide the number of people who took a desired action by the total number of website visitors. For example, if 1,000 people visited your website and 100 of them signed up for a free trial, your conversion rate would be 10%.

##5. Churn Rate

Churn rate measures the percentage of customers who cancel or don’t renew their subscription in a given time period. This metric is important to track because it helps you understand how satisfied your customers are with your product and whether you need to make changes to reduce churn.

To calculate your churn rate, divide the number of customers who cancelled or didn’t renew their subscription by the total number of customers at the beginning of the time period. For example, if you had 100 customers at the beginning of the month and 10 of them cancelled, your churn rate would be 10%.

##6. Net Promoter Score (NPS)

NPS measures customer loyalty and satisfaction by asking customers how likely they are to recommend your product to a friend or colleague. This metric is important to track because it helps you understand how likely your customers are to promote your product through word-of-mouth.

To calculate your NPS, ask customers to rate their likelihood to recommend your product on a scale of 0-10. Customers who rate 0-6 are considered detractors, 7-8 are considered passive, and 9-10 are considered promoters. To calculate your NPS, subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters.

## Conclusion

Growth hacking is all about experimentation and data-driven decision making. By tracking these key metrics, you’ll be able to understand how effective your growth hacking efforts are and make adjustments as needed. Keep in mind that these metrics are just a starting point, and you may need to track additional metrics depending on your business goals and growth strategy.
