# Why SaaS Startups Need to Prioritize Accessibility for People with Disabilities

As a founder of a SaaS startup, you may be focused on creating a product that is innovative, user-friendly, and appealing to customers. However, there is one important aspect that is often neglected â€“ accessibility for people with disabilities.

In today's world, technology has become an essential part of our daily lives. We communicate, work, and live through technology. Access to technology is crucial for people with disabilities in order to live independently and participate fully in society.

According to the World Health Organization, approximately 15% of the world's population has some form of disability, and this number is expected to increase with an aging population. This means that as a founder, it is important to consider accessibility in your product design in order to reach a larger and more diverse audience.

In this blog post, we will explore why SaaS startups need to prioritize accessibility for people with disabilities and how doing so can benefit both your company and your users.

## What is Accessibility?

Accessibility refers to the design of products, services, and environments that can be used by people with disabilities. It aims to provide equal access and opportunity to people with disabilities, enabling them to participate equally in society.

In the context of SaaS startups, accessibility means designing and developing products that can be used by people with disabilities, including those with visual, hearing, physical, and cognitive disabilities.

## Why Accessibility is Important for SaaS Startups

1. Social Responsibility: 

Accessibility is a social responsibility. As a founder, you have a responsibility to ensure that your product can be used by everyone, regardless of their ability. By prioritizing accessibility, you are demonstrating your commitment to social responsibility and inclusivity.

2. Legal Requirements:

In some countries, accessibility is a legal requirement, and failure to comply can result in legal action. This means that by neglecting accessibility in your product design, you may be exposing your company to legal risk.

3. Competitive Advantage:

Accessibility can be a powerful competitive advantage. By designing a product that is accessible, you are reaching a larger and more diverse audience. This can help you gain a competitive advantage, as people with disabilities may be more likely to choose your product over a competitor's product that is not accessible.

4. Improved User Experience:

Accessibility can improve the user experience for all users. For example, closed captions on videos can benefit people with hearing disabilities as well as people who are watching a video in a noisy environment. Similarly, larger font sizes can benefit people with visual disabilities as well as people who are viewing the content on a small screen.

## How to Prioritize Accessibility in Your SaaS Startup

1. Involve People with Disabilities in Your Product Design:

The best way to ensure that your product is accessible is to involve people with disabilities in your product design process. You can do this by conducting user testing with people who have disabilities or by hiring accessibility consultants who can provide feedback on your product design.

2. Follow Accessibility Guidelines:

There are several accessibility guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), that provide recommendations for designing accessible products. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your product is accessible to the largest possible audience.

3. Provide Alternative Text and Captions:

Alternative text and captions are essential for people with visual and hearing disabilities. By providing alternative text for images and captions for videos, you can ensure that people with disabilities can access your content.

4. Choose Accessible Technology:

When selecting technology for your product, it is important to choose technologies that are accessible. For example, if you are building a website, you should choose a content management system (CMS) that is accessible.

## Conclusion

Accessibility is an essential aspect of product design that is often neglected. As a founder of a SaaS startup, it is important to prioritize accessibility in your product design in order to reach a larger and more diverse audience. By doing so, you can demonstrate your commitment to social responsibility, comply with legal requirements, gain a competitive advantage, and improve the user experience for all users.

Prioritizing accessibility in your SaaS startup may require additional effort and resources, but it is worth it. By providing equal access and opportunity to people with disabilities, you are contributing to a more inclusive and equitable society.
