# Why SaaS Startups Need to Incorporate Accessibility by Design

Every business has a responsibility to ensure that its technology is accessible to everyone. For SaaS startups, accessibility can make or break the success of the company, especially during the early stages of development. Although it may not seem like a top priority, integrating accessibility features into a SaaS startup’s product from the outset can significantly impact the product’s success, user growth, and overall impact.

## What is Accessibility by Design?

Accessibility by Design is an approach to product development that considers the needs of all users, including those who may have physical, cognitive, or sensory impairments. This approach takes into account the diversity of users and proactively designs products and services that are accessible to everyone. 

## The Importance of Accessibility

There are many reasons why accessibility should be a priority for SaaS startups. The most pressing amongst these reasons are:

### Increased Reach and Market Share

By incorporating accessibility features and tools, SaaS startups can broaden their reach and attract a wider audience. Accessibility features allow startups to better serve customers who may have certain disabilities or limitations that prevent them from fully utilizing the product. This, in turn, creates a more inclusive and diverse user base, which can increase the startup’s market share, ultimately leading to increased user acquisition and revenue.

### Higher User Engagement

Users who experience difficulties using a product, such as those with disabilities, are less likely to continue using a product than those who have no issues. SaaS startups need to strive to deliver a seamless user experience, which accessibility features can help with. By offering accessibility options, startups can keep users interested and engaged with the product.

### Compliance with Regulations

Many countries have laws that mandate accessible product development. Therefore, incorporating accessibility measures is not only crucial in terms of providing an inclusive user experience, but also legally imperative. Failing to meet accessibility standards may result in lawsuits or penalties, which can be costly and detrimental for SaaS startups.

## Examples of Accessibility Features

There are many ways that SaaS startups can incorporate accessibility features into their products. These include:

### Assistive Technology 

Assistive technology includes hardware and software tools that are designed to assist individuals with disabilities. These can include visual aids, speech-to-text software, and automatic text readers. By incorporating such technology into their products, startups can make it easier for users with disabilities to interact with the product.

### Color Contrast 

Color contrast can make a huge difference to visually impaired users, allowing them to better distinguish between different elements on a page. Startups can improve accessibility by ensuring that there is enough contrast between foreground and background colors.

### Alternative Text (Alt text)

Alt text is a description that is read by screen readers for text that accompanies images. By including alt text, SaaS startups can enable visually impaired users to easily understand the context of images on the page.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, accessibility should be a top priority for SaaS startups if they wish to be successful, grow their user base, and impact and change the world. By developing a product with accessibility in mind, startups can create a more inclusive business and play a significant role in promoting technological advancement for all. 

SaaS startups should ensure that their product is developed with assistive technologies, contrast, and alt text in mind. Ultimately, accessibility is not just the right thing to do but the smart thing to do to make their product successful.
