# How to Build a Successful SaaS Reseller Program

As a SaaS startup founder, one of the most important goals is to achieve rapid and sustainable growth in a highly competitive market. One of the best ways to do this is to establish a reseller program where partners promote and sell your SaaS products to their customers in exchange for a commission.

A SaaS reseller program is more than a simple affiliate marketing scheme. It is a strategic partnership that helps your company expand your reach, increase revenue, and build relationships with customers. Building a successful SaaS reseller program requires a well-planned strategy that addresses several key factors. In this post, we’ll explain how to build a successful SaaS reseller program by focusing on the following five key elements:

1. Identify the Right Resellers

The first step towards building a successful SaaS reseller program is to identify the right resellers who can effectively promote and sell your SaaS product. Resellers can be individuals, small businesses or larger organizations who have an existing customer base and are willing to promote your product to their customers.

To identify potential resellers, you can start by conducting market research to identify companies that serve your target market. You can also reach out to current customers or other contacts in your industry to ask for referrals. Another option is to attend industry events and conferences to meet potential resellers.

It’s important to ensure that the resellers you choose align with your company’s values, mission and vision. They should also have experience selling products similar to yours and be able to provide value-added services to their customers.

2. Define Your Reseller Program

Once you have identified potential resellers, the next step is to define your reseller program. A well-defined program will set clear expectations for your resellers, outline the commission structure and provide the necessary resources to help them promote and sell your product.

The reseller program should include the following information:

* Commission structure: Define the commission rates and incentives for resellers to promote and sell your product.

* Reseller requirements: Define the requirements for resellers to join the program, including any training or certification requirements.

* Product information: Provide resellers with a detailed product description, including features, pricing, and benefits.

* Marketing materials: Provide resellers with promotional materials such as product brochures, case studies, and sales scripts.

* Support resources: Provide resellers with tools and resources to help them support their customers, including customer service support, technical support, and training.

3. Provide Incentives 

Incentives play a crucial role in building a successful SaaS reseller program. Offering financial and non-financial incentives encourages resellers to promote and sell your product. Financial incentives could include discounts, rebates or commission rates. Non-financial incentives could include access to exclusive resources, training programs or marketing support.

To offer the right incentives, consider the following factors:

* Reseller performance: Offer incentives that are directly tied to reseller performance, such as commission rates that increase as sales volume grows.

* Customer lifetime value: Offer incentives that encourage resellers to focus on customer retention and create long-term value for customers.

* Sales cycle: Offer incentives that encourage resellers to close deals quickly, to improve cash flow and reduce the sales cycle.

4. Build Strong Relationships

Building strong relationships with your resellers is essential to building a successful SaaS reseller program. You can build strong relationships by providing resellers with ongoing support, training, and resources. You can also keep your resellers engaged by providing regular updates on product developments, new releases, and industry news.

Additionally, building strong relationships means being flexible and responsive to your resellers’ needs. This requires listening to feedback, addressing concerns, and continually adapting to evolving market and customer demands.

5. Monitor Performance

To ensure the success of your SaaS reseller program, it’s important to continually monitor and measure your reseller’s performance. Regularly tracking your reseller’s sales volume, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction will help you identify areas for improvement and any reseller performance issues.

Monitoring performance can also help you identify potential issues with your product, pricing or customer support, allowing you to make changes to improve your product and reseller program.

Conclusion

Building a successful SaaS reseller program requires careful planning and execution. Focusing on the right elements will set you up for success in achieving rapid and sustainable growth. By identifying the right resellers, defining your reseller program, providing incentives, building strong relationships and monitoring performance, you can establish a successful SaaS reseller program that helps you increase revenue, expand your reach and build strong relationships with your customers.
