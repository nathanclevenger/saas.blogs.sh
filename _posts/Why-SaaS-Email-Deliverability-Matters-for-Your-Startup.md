# Why SaaS Email Deliverability Matters for Your Startup

As a founder of a SaaS startup, there are numerous challenges that you need to overcome to ensure that your business thrives. One such challenge is ensuring that your email campaigns are delivered to your customers' inboxes. This is where email deliverability comes into play. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at email deliverability, why it matters for your SaaS startup, and what you can do to improve it.

## What is Email Deliverability?

Email deliverability refers to the ability of your email messages to reach their intended target's inbox. This means that your email campaigns should avoid getting lost in spam or junk folders. When an email campaign has a high deliverability rate, it means that it has a higher likelihood of reaching your audience and generating more revenue.

## Why Does Email Deliverability Matter for Your SaaS Startup?

Email marketing has been a crucial part of SaaS marketing strategies for a long time. It is one of the most cost-effective ways to reach existing and potential customers, as well as promote your brand. According to a survey by DMA, email marketing has an ROI of 38:1, which means that for every $1 spent on email marketing, you can expect a return of $38.

However, if your emails are not reaching your customers' inboxes, you may be wasting your time and money. If your email campaigns get sent to spam, your customers will not receive them, and your marketing efforts will be in vain. Email deliverability is, therefore, essential for your SaaS startup for the following reasons:

### 1. Improved Customer Engagement

Email campaigns can be useful in increasing customer engagement. Suppose your email campaigns have a high deliverability rate. In that case, you increase the chances of your customers opening, clicking, and engaging with your email content. This allows you to keep your customers informed about new product features, updates, and promotions, among other things, and increases your chances of generating more revenue.

### 2. Increased Revenue

As previously mentioned, email marketing has a high ROI. Email campaigns with high deliverability rates have a higher likelihood of being delivered to your customers' inboxes, increasing the chances of them reading and acting on your email content. This can lead to increased revenue for your SaaS startup.

### 3. Better Customer Relationships

Email campaigns can be a great way to build and maintain relationships with your customers. If your email campaigns have a high deliverability rate, your customers are more likely to see them and interact with them. This can help build trust and credibility with your customers and improve customer loyalty.

### 4. Increased Brand Visibility

Email campaigns can be a great way to promote your SaaS startup and increase brand visibility. If your email campaigns have a high deliverability rate, your customers are more likely to see them and remember your brand. This can help increase brand awareness and promote your SaaS startup to a wider audience.

## Factors that Affect Email Deliverability

Now that we’ve seen why email deliverability matters, let's take a closer look at some of the factors that affect it. These factors include:

### 1. Email Authentication

Email authentication is the process of verifying that an email message is coming from a legitimate sender. There are several authentication methods, including SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. Implementing email authentication can improve your email deliverability because it helps email providers verify that your email campaigns are legitimate and not spam.

### 2. Email Reputation

Email reputation refers to the reputation of your domain and IP address, which indicates whether your emails are trustworthy or not. To improve your email reputation, you should avoid sending spam emails, monitor your engagement rates, and respond promptly to any spam complaints.

### 3. List Hygiene

List hygiene involves maintaining a clean email list by removing inactive and invalid email addresses. This helps improve your email deliverability by reducing the likelihood that your emails will be sent to spam folders.

### 4. Content

The content of your email campaigns can also affect your email deliverability. Spam filters are designed to detect and prevent spam emails, and they often scan your email content to determine whether it is spammy or not. To avoid getting flagged as spam, you should avoid using spam trigger words, keep your subject lines relevant, and personalize your email content.

## How to Improve Email Deliverability for Your SaaS Startup

Monitoring your email reputation can help you identify any issues with your email campaigns that may be affecting your deliverability. You can use email deliverability monitoring tools such as Return Path or SendForensics to monitor your email reputation and identify any issues that may be affecting your email deliverability.

### 3. Practice List Hygiene

Practicing list hygiene involves maintaining a clean email list by removing inactive and invalid email addresses. This helps improve your email deliverability by reducing the likelihood that your emails will be sent to spam folders.
