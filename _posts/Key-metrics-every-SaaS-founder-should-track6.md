# Key Metrics Every SaaS Founder Should Track

As a SaaS founder, keeping track of key metrics is crucial for making informed decisions and optimizing your business strategies. Knowing the right metrics to focus on can help you to evaluate your business progress and improve customer satisfaction.

In this blog post, we will discuss the top key metrics that every SaaS founder should track for better business performance.

## 1. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is the total amount of revenue generated by your SaaS product monthly. It is an essential metric for SaaS companies as it helps to measure the financial health of the business. By tracking MRR, SaaS founders can identify trends and patterns in their revenue performance, which is crucial for making informed business decisions.

## 2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is the cost incurred by your business when acquiring each new customer. It is essential to track CAC to ensure that your business is acquiring new customers cost-effectively. By keeping CAC low, you can improve your profit margins and make your business more profitable.

## 3. Churn Rate

Churn rate is the percentage of customers who churn or cancel their subscriptions each month. It is an essential metric for evaluating customer satisfaction and loyalty to your product. A high churn rate could mean that customers are not satisfied with your product, which can lead to a decline in MRR. SaaS founders should track churn rate closely and implement strategies to reduce it.

## 4. Lifetime Value (LTV)

Lifetime value (LTV) is the total revenue generated by each customer over their lifetime. It is a critical metric for SaaS founders as it helps to measure the long-term profitability of the business. By increasing LTV, SaaS companies can maximize revenue per customer and improve profit margins.

## 5. Monthly Active Users (MAU)

Monthly Active Users (MAU) is the number of unique users who use your product each month. It is important to track MAU to understand how many users are engaging with your product each month. By increasing MAU, you can improve overall customer engagement and retention rates.

## 6. Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is an essential metric for evaluating customer satisfaction and loyalty. By asking customers how likely they are to recommend your product to others, you can identify areas for improvement and implement strategies to improve customer satisfaction.

## 7. Customer Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Cost Ratio (LTV:CAC)

The Customer Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Cost Ratio (LTV:CAC) is a crucial metric for understanding the long-term profitability of your business. By comparing LTV to CAC, you can determine whether your business is acquiring and retaining customers cost-effectively.

## 8. User Engagement Metrics

User engagement metrics are crucial for SaaS founders to track as they help to evaluate how users are engaging with your product. By tracking metrics such as time spent on the application or pages visited, you can identify how users are interacting with your product and improve user engagement.

## 9. Conversion Rates

Conversion rates are another critical metric for SaaS founders to track. By tracking conversion rates, you can identify where users drop off in your sales funnel and implement strategies to improve conversion rates.

## 10. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) is the average revenue generated by each user of your product. It is an essential metric for SaaS businesses as it helps to measure the revenue potential of each user. By increasing ARPU, SaaS founders can maximize revenue per customer and improve profit margins.

## Conclusion

Tracking key metrics is crucial for the success of your SaaS business. By focusing on the right metrics, you can identify trends, make informed decisions and optimize your business strategies. The metrics listed above are essential for every SaaS founder to track and monitor, as they will help to improve your overall business performance and customer satisfaction.
