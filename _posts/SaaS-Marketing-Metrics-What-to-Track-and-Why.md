# SaaS Marketing Metrics: What to Track and Why

As a SaaS founder looking to create, build, launch, grow, and scale your business, tracking your marketing metrics is critical to your success. Without the ability to measure and analyze the effectiveness of your marketing efforts, you can’t make informed decisions about how to allocate your resources and optimize your strategy. 

In this blog post, we’ll discuss the marketing metrics you should be tracking, why they matter, and how to use them to grow your SaaS business. 

## 1. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is the total amount of money it costs to acquire a new customer. This includes all marketing and sales expenses during the time period analyzed divided by the number of new customers acquired in that time period. 

Why does CAC matter? Knowing your customer acquisition costs helps you understand the profitability of your marketing channels and informs your investment decisions. If your CAC is higher than the Lifetime Value (LTV) of your customers, you’re losing money on every sale. To be profitable, your CAC must remain lower than your LTV, which is why this metric is so important. 

## 2. Conversion Rates

Conversion rates indicate how many prospects take a desired action, such as signing up for a free trial or purchasing a subscription. The formula for conversion rate is the total number of prospects divided by the number of conversions. 

Why do conversion rates matter? By tracking your conversion rates, you can pinpoint which marketing channels, campaigns and landing pages are performing well and which need improvements. Conversion rates are particularly useful in analyzing your sales funnel and identifying bottlenecks that may be hindering conversions. 

## 3. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is the monthly subscription revenue generated by your customers. It's calculated by multiplying the number of subscribers by the average revenue per user (ARPU). 

Why does MRR matter? As a SaaS business, your revenue is largely based on recurring subscriptions. Knowing and increasing your MRR is essential to building revenue stability and predictability, as well as to attracting investment. 

## 4. Churn Rate

Churn rate refers to the percentage of customers who cancel their subscriptions during a given time frame. The formula for churn rate is the number of subscribers lost during the month divided by the number of subscribers at the beginning of the month. 

Why does churn rate matter? The higher your churn rate, the harder it becomes to grow your MRR. If your churn rate is high, you’ll need to win back lost customers or replace them with new ones, which can be an expensive process. Reducing churn rates increases customer lifetime value (CLV) and allows you to allocate resources more efficiently. 

## 5. Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Net Promoter Score (NPS) measures the likelihood that a customer would recommend your product to a friend or colleague. It's calculated using a survey that asks customers to rate their likelihood to recommend your product on a scale of 1-10. 

Why does NPS matter? A high NPS indicates high customer satisfaction and loyalty, which translates into better retention rates and more referrals. Tracking NPS helps you identify opportunities for improvement and areas where you’re excelling. 

## 6. Cost per Acquisition (CPA)

Cost per Acquisition (CPA) is the cost of acquiring a new customer through a specific channel, such as social media or email marketing. It's calculated by dividing the total cost of the campaign by the number of new customers acquired. 

Why does CPA matter? By knowing which channels have the lowest CPA, you can reduce your CAC and increase profitability. By optimizing your CPA through experimentation, you can improve the efficiency of your campaigns and allocate resources more efficiently. 

## 7. Return on Investment (ROI)

Return on Investment (ROI) measures the returns generated by your marketing investments. It's calculated by dividing the net profit (revenue minus expenses) by the costs incurred. 

Why does ROI matter? By tracking your ROI, you can determine which campaigns are generating the greatest return on investment and which are under-performing. This allows you to optimize your strategy, reduce costs, and increase profitability. 

## 8. Average Sales Cycle Length 

The average sales cycle length is the average time it takes to convert a prospect into a paying customer. It's calculated from the first point of contact to when the customer signs the contract. 

Why does the average sales cycle length matter? By tracking this metric, you can identify where your sales process may be getting bogged down and what you can do to streamline it. Shortening the sales cycle can boost your revenue, resource efficiency, and the overall customer experience. 

## 9. Lead-to-Customer Conversion Rate

The lead-to-customer conversion rate is the percentage of leads who become paying customers. It's calculated by dividing the number of customers who convert from leads by the total number of leads. 

Why does the lead-to-customer conversion rate matter? By knowing the conversion rate, you can identify ways to improve the quality of your leads and reduce the number of unqualified ones. This can increase the efficiency of your sales process and lead to better revenue growth.
