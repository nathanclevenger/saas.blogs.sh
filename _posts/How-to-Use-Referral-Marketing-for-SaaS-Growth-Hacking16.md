At the core of this marketing method is the simple principle of word-of-mouth marketing, where satisfied customers promote your product or service to a wider audience.

- Increase conversions

Knowing your goals will help you determine what type of incentive you should offer and how to track the success of your referral marketing efforts.

## Step 2: Build a Referral Program That Works

Once you have defined your goals, it's time to build a referral program that works. There are several different types of referral programs that you can implement, including:

- One-sided referral programs – These programs offer incentives only to the referring customer, such as a discount or a free month of service.
- Two-sided referral programs – These programs offer incentives to both the referring customer and the new customer, such as a discount for both or a free month of service for both.

The type of referral program you choose will depend on your business goals, customer base, and the incentives you are able to offer.

## Step 3: Choose Your Incentives

The incentive you offer for referrals is key to the success of your referral program. You need to offer something that encourages your existing customers to promote your product or service to a wider audience. Some incentive options include:

- Discounts or coupons

It's important to choose an incentive that aligns with your business goals and that your customers will find valuable.

Promotion can be done in a variety of ways, including:

- Email marketing campaigns
- Social media posts
- On-site pop-ups or banners
- In-app messages

You should also consider creating a landing page specifically for your referral program. This will make it easy for customers to learn about the program and share it with their friends and family.

## Step 5: Track Your Referral Program Metrics

To know if your referral marketing campaign is successful, you need to track your program's metrics. Some important metrics you should track include:

- Number of referrals
